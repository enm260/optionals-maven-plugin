# Optionals maven plugin
## Overview
Optional dependencies, while useful for enabling/disabling features which may not be needed in all cases, are easy to misuse.  Since the effect of marking a dependency as optional is similar to changing the scope of a dependency there is the possibility of a dependency being marked optional when a scope of provided or even test may be a better solution.  The problem with this is that optional dependencies do not show up in the dependency tree as a transitive dependency so it can be difficult to discover these optional dependencies unless you are already familiar with the project where it was marked optional.  To make matters worse, there is no simple way to restrict optional dependencies (aside from those that that are not specific to optional dependencies such as the enforcer plugin) or even list them from the project which marked them optional.  The goal of this project is to allow optional dependencies to be restricted and to simplify working with optional dependencies in general.
